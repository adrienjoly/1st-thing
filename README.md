# 1st Thing In The Morning

This repo is a fork of [an app made with Osman Abdelnasir (@esaminu)](https://github.com/AsianMeteorites/1st-thing) [during the Meteor Hackathon, in October 2015](http://devpost.com/software/1st-thing-in-the-morning).

The goal is to give you the motivation to execute your tasks, every morning.

## Inspiration

[This article](http://productivityhacks.org/overcoming-procrastination/) says that procrastination prevents us from succeeding in our projects, and that one way to beat it is to write down a list of simple tasks, and commit to it. So we are building an app that helps you do that.

## What it does

Every morning, it sends a notification to your mobile phone, with a reminder of all the tasks you want to do today, and a motivational image to give you the energy to do them.

Work in progress...
